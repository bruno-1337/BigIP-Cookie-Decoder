# BigIP-Cookie-Decoder
This is a simple python script that can decode the cookie value generated by the BIG-IP LTM system. It can extract the IP address and port of the destination server from the cookie value.



# Usage
To use this script, you need to have python 3 installed on your system. You can run the script from the command line as follows:
```sh
python decode_cookie.py -c <cookie_value>
```

where <cookie_value> is the cookie value that you want to decode. For example:
```sh
python decode_cookie.py -c 1677787402.36895.0000
```
The script will print the decoded IP address and port of the destination server. For example:

10.1.1.100:8080
